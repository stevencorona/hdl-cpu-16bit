This is my implementation of a 16-bit CPU in HDL. It includes an assembler, virtual machine, three high-level language compilers (basic c, java/scala-esque, and ruby-ish), and an operating system. Assume that everything is unoptimized.

This code is free for any use. You do not have to give credit back to me. You can use it in any project you'd like, open or closed source. DWTFYW.
