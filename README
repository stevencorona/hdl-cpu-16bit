ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is the main chunk right now. This is the spec:

/**
 * The ALU.  Computes a pre-defined set of functions out = f(x,y)
 * where x and y are two 16-bit inputs. The function f is selected
 * by a set of 6 control bits denoted zx, nx, zy, ny, f, no.
 * The ALU operation can be described using the following pseudocode:
 *     if zx=1 set x = 0       // 16-bit zero constant
 *     if nx=1 set x = !x      // Bit-wise negation
 *     if zy=1 set y = 0       // 16-bit zero constant
 *     if ny=1 set y = !y      // Bit-wise negation
 *     if f=1  set out = x + y // Integer 2's complement addition
 *     else    set out = x & y // Bit-wise And
 *     if no=1 set out = !out  // Bit-wise negation
 *
 * In addition to computing out, the ALU computes two 1-bit outputs:
 *     if out=0 set zr = 1 else zr = 0 // 16-bit equality comparison
 *     if out<0 set ng = 1 else ng = 0 // 2's complement comparison
 */

There are some other "chips" that I made because I needed them and the HDL simulator did not have them built in.
